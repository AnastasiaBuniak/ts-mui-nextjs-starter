    title: Logic for 90/180 visa rule calculation
    description: >
      The 90/180-day rule is a common visa regulation used in the Schengen Area and some other countries. The rule states that:
    keyPoints: 
      - A visitor cannot stay in the Schengen Zone for more than 90 days within any rolling 180-day period.
      - The 180-day period is not fixed; it’s a moving window, meaning each new day moves the counting period forward.
      - The rule applies to all short-term visa-free travelers (e.g., UK, US, Canadian, and Australian passport holders visiting Schengen).

    title: Key rules for calculating visa days. How to calculate?
    description: 
    keyPoints: 
      - Every new entry counts towards the rolling 180-day window
      - Exiting doesn’t reset the count; previous stays in the past 180 days still matter
      - Multiple stays are combined; if a person leaves and re-enters, previous days are still counted
      - If a traveler has already stayed 90 days in the past 180 days, they must leave and wait until days “drop off” before re-entering
